<p>Hi. My name is Arthur. This blog is about my technical adventures and interests. To give you an idea of what type of content you will find here, this is a list of my interests in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Analysis</li>
<li>Data Visualization</li>
<li>DIY Electronics</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Web Technologies</li>
<li>Automation</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>System Administration</li>
<li>Command Line Interface</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a tendency to overthink things so I try to write to a theoretical audience of like-minded, similarly-skilled people. This helps me organize ideas, and focus on the one topic and scope.</p>
<p>I live in Brooklyn with my beautiful wife, Esther and our amazing son, Nathan.</p>
